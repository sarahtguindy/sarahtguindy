ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Sarah Guindy

A cybersecurity enthusiast and privacy advocate. I am typically either coding, reading about the latest vulnerability, or creating pixel art in my spare time. I also spend way too much time in the terminal. Feel free to message me here, or alternatively by email for serious inquiries.

Here you'll find continuous work in progress! Here you can find a few of the projects I've worked on, useful scripts I've created, my dotfiles, and more.
