### Hey, I’m Sarah 👋

A cybersecurity enthusiast and privacy advocate. I am typically either coding, reading about the latest vulnerability, or creating pixel art in my spare time. I also spend way too much time in the terminal.

This repo is a continuous work in progress! Here you can find a few of the projects I've worked on, useful scripts, dotfiles, and more.
