### Hey, Iâ€™m Sarah ðŸ‘‹

A cybersecurity enthusiast and privacy advocate. I am typically either coding, reading about the latest vulnerability, or creating pixel art in my spare time. I also spend way too much time in the terminal. Feel free to message me on LinkedIn, or alternatively by email for serious inquiries.

This repo is a continuous work in progress! Here you can find a few of the projects I've worked on, useful scripts I've created, my dotfiles, and more.
